R-CNN designed to handle the Standford Cars dataset.
Largely copied from: https://github.com/foamliu/Car-Recognition
However adjusted to require slightly less pre-processing, and to be slightly more user-friendly.

To begin, extract all files into a common directory. In the same directory create a sub-directory called 'datasets'.
In here, you will want to put the training and test images, however you will want to combine all images into two files:
train_cars.h5 and test_cars.h5.
To create these two files, use the 'h5write.py' script found here: https://github.com/EvanEames/h5_ReadWrite (note that you will also need the 'devkit/train_perfect_preds.txt' and 'devkit/test_perfect_preds.txt' files to create the h5 files. These txt files should be packaged with the cars dataset).
Once you have created them, place these h5 files in the datasets directory, and then run CarModel.py.
